# iOS-Calendar-Infinite-Scrolling

Infinite Scrolling iOS Calendar implemented by Objective-C in Xcode 8.2

Anyone can use this code for implementing or adding calendar function in iOS app.

Currently I am not used to GitHub. This is my first GitHub repository.

All comments of codes are written by Korean.

I did not use AutoLayout for various screen size of iOS devices.

Instead, get the screen size of current iOS device and adjust font size, frame size and label size using simple math.

(so to speak; multiplication and division...)

Code is not clean and some file is not used. for example PSHEvent..... file is not used.

I will add english comments, improve readability, reusability and code documentation.

Again, I am not used to GitHub.
