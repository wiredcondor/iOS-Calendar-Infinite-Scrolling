This is my first GitHub repository.

Infinite Scrolling iOS Calendar implemented by Objective-C.

This is my toy project to implement iOS calendar function based on native Objective-C.

All comments of codes are written by **Korean**.

I did not use AutoLayout for various screen size of iOS devices.

Instead, get the screen size of current iOS device and adjust font size, frame size and label size using simple math.
(so to speak; multiplication and division...)

Some file is not used. for example PSHEvent..... files are not used.

I will continue to improve code for everyone and add english comments and give detail code documentation.
